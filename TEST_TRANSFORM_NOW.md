# ðŸ§ª IMMEDIATE TRANSFORM CONTROLS TEST

## Step-by-Step Test Instructions

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd /workspace/frontend && npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Debug Page
**Go to:** `http://localhost:5173/debug-transform`

**What you should see:**
- âš« Dark scene with grid lines
- ðŸ”´ Red cube on the left
- ðŸŸ¢ Green sphere in the center  
- ðŸ”µ Blue cylinder on the right
- ðŸ“‹ Instructions panel (top-left)

### 3. Test Transform Controls
1. **Click on the red cube**
   - Should see: Blue status panel appears (top-right)
   - Should see: Object gets slightly highlighted
   - **MOST IMPORTANTLY**: Should see **colored arrows/handles** around the cube

2. **If you see the transform controls (arrows):**
   - âœ… **SUCCESS!** Drag the arrows to move the cube
   - Press `R` or click "Scale" button to switch to scale mode
   - Drag the scale handles (cubes) to scale the object

3. **If you DON'T see transform controls:**
   - Check browser console (F12) for error messages
   - Try clicking directly on the objects
   - Try different browsers

### 4. Test All Modes
- **Translate mode (W)**: Should see colored arrows
- **Rotate mode (E)**: Should see colored circles  
- **Scale mode (R)**: Should see colored cubes

### 5. Expected Results
If working correctly:
- âœ… Transform handles appear around selected objects
- âœ… Objects can be dragged and transformed in real-time
- âœ… Mode switching works with keyboard and buttons
- âœ… Console shows detailed logs

## ðŸš¨ If Transform Controls Still Don't Appear

This would indicate a fundamental issue with:
1. Three.js TransformControls import/initialization
2. Rendering pipeline
3. Browser compatibility
4. Canvas/WebGL setup

**Please test this debug page and let me know exactly what you see!**

The debug page is specifically designed to isolate and test ONLY the transform controls functionality without any other scene complexity.
