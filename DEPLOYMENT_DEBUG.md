# 🔧 Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Status
Your AR Configurator has been cleaned up and configured for Vercel deployment, but you're getting 404 errors.

## 🚨 Most Likely Causes & Solutions

### 1. Build Command Issue
**In Vercel Dashboard:**
- Go to Settings → Build & Development Settings
- Set these exact values:
  ```
  Build Command: cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
  Output Directory: frontend/dist
  Install Command: npm install
  Root Directory: ./
  ```

### 2. Check Deployment Logs
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your failed deployment
3. Check the "Build Logs" tab
4. Look for specific error messages

**Common errors and fixes:**
- **"No such file or directory"**: Wrong paths in build command
- **"Build failed"**: Missing dependencies or build errors
- **"Output directory not found"**: Wrong output directory path

### 3. Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.vercel.app
```

## 🎯 Immediate Action Steps

### Step 1: Check Your Current Vercel Settings
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your AR project
3. Go to Settings → Build & Development Settings
4. Screenshot or copy the current settings

### Step 2: Update Build Settings
Change to these exact settings:
```
Framework Preset: Other
Root Directory: ./ (leave blank or set to root)
Build Command: cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
Output Directory: frontend/dist
Install Command: npm install
```

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
3. Watch the build logs for errors

## 🐛 Alternative Approaches

### Option A: Deploy Frontend Only First
Update your `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "frontend/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/frontend/dist/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Option B: Separate Repositories
1. Deploy frontend in current repo
2. Create new repo for backend API
3. Connect them via environment variables

## 📋 Debug Checklist

- [ ] Vercel build command is correct
- [ ] Output directory exists (`frontend/dist`)
- [ ] `frontend/dist/index.html` exists
- [ ] No errors in build logs
- [ ] Environment variables are set
- [ ] `vercel.json` is in root directory

## 🔍 What Information I Need

Please share:
1. **Vercel build logs** (from the deployment that failed)
2. **Current Vercel build settings** (screenshot or text)
3. **The exact error message** you see when visiting the site
4. **Your Vercel project URL**

## 🚀 Quick Test

Try this simpler approach:
1. Delete `vercel.json` temporarily
2. In Vercel settings, set:
   - Build Command: `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `frontend/dist`
3. Redeploy

This will help us identify if the issue is with the `vercel.json` configuration or the build process itself.
