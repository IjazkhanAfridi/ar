# Transform Controls Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Test Instructions

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
cd /workspace/frontend && npm run dev
```

### 2. Test the Transform Controls

#### A. Test with the Green Test Cube
1. **Open the application** in your browser
2. **Look for a green semi-transparent cube** in the 3D scene (positioned at x:2, y:1, z:0)
3. **Click on the green cube** - you should see:
   - Transform controls appear around the cube (colored arrows/handles)
   - "Selected: test" indicator in top-right corner
   - Console logs showing "Object selected" and "Transform controls attached"

#### B. Test Transform Modes
1. **With the cube selected**, try these keyboard shortcuts:
   - Press `W` - Switch to **Translate** mode (arrows for moving)
   - Press `E` - Switch to **Rotate** mode (circles for rotation)
   - Press `R` - Switch to **Scale** mode (cubes for scaling)

2. **Or use the UI buttons** on the right sidebar:
   - Click "Move" button
   - Click "Rotate" button  
   - Click "Scale" button

#### C. Test Interactive Transformation
1. **Translate Mode (W or Move button)**:
   - Drag the **red arrow** to move along X-axis
   - Drag the **green arrow** to move along Y-axis
   - Drag the **blue arrow** to move along Z-axis

2. **Rotate Mode (E or Rotate button)**:
   - Drag the **red circle** to rotate around X-axis
   - Drag the **green circle** to rotate around Y-axis
   - Drag the **blue circle** to rotate around Z-axis

3. **Scale Mode (R or Scale button)**:
   - Drag the **center white cube** for uniform scaling
   - Drag the **colored cubes** for axis-specific scaling
   - Drag the **colored squares** for plane scaling

### 3. Test with Uploaded Content

#### A. Add Content
1. **Use the left sidebar** to add content (image, model, video, etc.)
2. **Click on the uploaded content** in the 3D scene
3. **Verify transform controls appear** on the uploaded content

#### B. Test All Modes
- Repeat the transform mode tests with your uploaded content
- Verify that transformations are applied in real-time
- Check that changes are saved and persist

### 4. Expected Behaviors

#### ‚úÖ What Should Work
- **Visual Transform Controls**: Colored handles should appear around selected objects
- **Real-time Transformation**: Objects should move/rotate/scale as you drag
- **Mode Switching**: Keyboard shortcuts and buttons should change control types
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected object indicator should show current mode
- **Console Logging**: Browser console should show transformation events
- **Sidebar Selection**: Clicking objects in sidebar should select them with controls

#### ‚ùå Troubleshooting
If transform controls don't appear:
1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Try clicking directly on objects** in the 3D viewport
3. **Use keyboard shortcuts** (W/E/R) to switch modes
4. **Verify object selection** in the sidebar shows selected object highlighted

## üîß Technical Verification

### Console Logs to Look For
```
Transform controls initialized and added to scene
Test cube added for transform controls testing
Object selected: {id: "test-cube", type: "content", ...}
Transform controls attached to object: test-cube mode: translate
Object transformed: {position: {...}, rotation: {...}, scale: {...}}
Config updated for object: test-cube
```

### Visual Indicators
1. **Green pulsing dot** next to "Selected: [object-type]" 
2. **Transform handles** visible around selected objects
3. **Highlighted mode button** in the sidebar
4. **Keyboard shortcuts panel** in top-left corner

## üéØ Success Criteria

The implementation is working correctly if you can:
1. ‚úÖ Select objects by clicking on them
2. ‚úÖ See transform controls appear around selected objects
3. ‚úÖ Switch between translate/rotate/scale modes
4. ‚úÖ Drag transform handles to modify objects in real-time
5. ‚úÖ Use keyboard shortcuts (W/E/R) for quick mode switching
6. ‚úÖ See visual feedback for selected objects and current mode
7. ‚úÖ Have transformations persist and update the configuration

## üö® Known Test Objects

- **Green Test Cube**: Automatically created for testing (remove in production)
- **Uploaded Content**: Any images, models, videos, audio files you add
- **Marker Plane**: The background marker image (if uploaded)

This comprehensive test should verify that your Three.js Transform Controls are working exactly like the official Three.js example!
